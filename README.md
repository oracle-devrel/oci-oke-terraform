## Introduction / Getting Started

In this tutorial (link provided below), I explain how to create multiple Kubernetes Clusters using Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) and I will be deploying these clusters in three different countries (regions). To speed up the deployment, and to deploy the Kubernetes Clusters consistently with the least amount of configuration mistakes I am using Terraform and some custom bash scripts.

The Terraform and Bash scripts provided in this GitHub repository, are created to complement the following tutorial:
